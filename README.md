This project draws inspiration from [`z`](https://github.com/rupa/z)

It aims to retain the main functionality of `z` all the while being more predictable and suitable for specifying relative paths.

The short-term goal is to provide the same functionality as the default `_cd()` function, then `z`-like behavior will be added.

Roadmap:
  [X] Autocomplete directory
  [X] Display when multiple options are available
  [ ] Autocomplete subdirectories
  [ ] Full `_cd()` compatibility
